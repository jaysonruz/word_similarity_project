# Product Similarity Tracker

A small Python project that uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) to determine whether product names are similar. It groups items by similarity and displays their prices in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Embeddings-based similarity**: Uses text embeddings to compute cosine similarity between product names.  
- **Grouping**: Groups prices for products determined to be similar.  
- **Easy extension**: You can easily change the threshold or embeddings model.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**  
- **pip** (usually included with Python)  
- A valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/) to use actual embeddings from OpenAI.

## Installation

1. **Clone** or **download** the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   Or [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

2. **Navigate** into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. (Recommended) **Create and activate** a virtual environment:

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Add your OpenAI API key** (if using real embeddings):
   
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root, and add:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or, if your virtual environment is active:
   ```bash
   (venv) python main.py
   ```

2. **View the output**: The script will display products grouped by similarity, showing their store name and price.

### Customizing Similarity Threshold

If you need to tweak how “strict” or “loose” the grouping is, adjust the `similarity > 0.8` threshold in `is_similar()`:

```python
def is_similar(product1, product2):
    # ...
    return similarity > 0.8
```

Increasing it (e.g., `0.9`) will make the grouping more selective. Lowering it (e.g., `0.7`) will group more items as similar.
